## Overview

**ImageFilterPy** provides a custom image filter that enhances image quality and processing speed. It is built on the MRTech IFF Python SDK, which allows developers to integrate advanced image processing capabilities into their applications. This repository aims to simplify the use of image filters and demonstrate their application in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Custom Image Filter**: Tailored specifically for the MRTech IFF SDK.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Handles various image formats like DNG, TIFF, and more.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes CUDA and Vulkan for enhanced performance.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time processing in machine vision applications.
- **REST API Support**: Easily integrate with other systems using a RESTful approach.
- **Example Demos**: Provides practical examples to get you started quickly.

## Installation

To install **ImageFilterPy**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sagar-brahaman/imagefilterpy.git
   cd imagefilterpy
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the MRTech IFF Python SDK installed. Refer to the SDK documentation for installation instructions.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the custom image filter in your Python scripts. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```python
from imagefilter import CustomImageFilter

# Load your image
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.dng'
filter = CustomImageFilter()

# Apply the filter
filtered_image = filter.apply(image_path)

# Save the result
filtered_image.save('path/to/save/filtered_image.tiff')
```

This example demonstrates how to load an image, apply the custom filter, and save the processed image. You can adjust parameters in the `CustomImageFilter` class to suit your needs.
